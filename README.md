# Bankruptcy in Taiwan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼
In this project, we'll work with financial data from the Emerging Markets Information Service. We'll look at financial indicators from  Taiwan, and build a model that predicts bankruptcy.In this project, we'll explore data collected by a team of Polish economists studying bankruptcy. Our goal is to build a model that can predict whether a company will go bankrupt or not.The particularity of this project is that our dataset is a json file. We therefore used Linux commands in our notebook to access the zipped json file. After unzipping it, we noticed that the classes in our target were unbalanced. The over- and under-sampling techniques were used before computerising two ensemblistic classification models (RandomForestClassifier and Gradient Boosting).
